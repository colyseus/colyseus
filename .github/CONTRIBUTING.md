## How to contribute to Colyseus

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Colyseus**, and instead send us an email at [endel@gamestd.io](mailto:endel@gamestd.io).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/gamestdio/colyseus/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/gamestdio/colyseus/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, make sure the tests are still passing, by running `npm test`.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Colyseus will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Colyseus in the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/gamestdio/colyseus).
